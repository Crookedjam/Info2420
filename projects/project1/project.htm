<li> <p>My first impression of the website was that it was full of pictures and information. 
I liked the hamburger menu it was organized and had some little pictures.</p> </li>

<li> <p>Trader Joe's website has an organized flow of information. 
It has a hamburger menu that takes you to spesific shoping items.</p></li>

<li> <p>Trader Joe's site makes sense to me it has shoping and info about upcoming events.</p> </li>

<li> <p>In my opinion I think the home page with all the info like crossword puzzles, fondue, and recipes is a little much for me.
If I just want to buy some cheese I might get desracted and forget to buy my cheese.</p> </li>

<li> <p>The load time was pretty fast for me considuring how many pictures there are.</p> </li>

<li> <p>The font color is mostly black against white so its easy to read. It uses headers good as well I always know what the main point is.</p> </li>

<li> <p>There are links on the main page example a <em>"discover more"</em> button to give more info on a specific subject.</p> </li>

<li> <p>The website has a theme all the buttons have shading and the same look.</p> </li>

<li> <p>Trader Joe's site is responsive. I looked at the site in half screen just fine.</p> </li>

<li> <p> I liked that it was very organized and at the bottomm of each page they had contact info. Very well done.</p> </li>
